DESCRIPTION
    This module contains an OpenSoundControl implementation (in Pure Python), based (somewhat) on the 
    good old 'SimpleOSC' implementation by Daniel Holth & Clinton McChesney.
    
    This implementation is intended to still be 'Simple' to the user, but much more complete
    (with OSCServer & OSCClient classes) and much more powerful
    (the OSCMultiClient supports subscriptions & message-filtering,
    OSCMessage & OSCBundle are now proper container-types)
    
    ================
    OpenSoundControl
    ================
    
    OpenSoundControl is a network-protocol for sending (small) packets of addressed data over network sockets.
    This OSC-implementation uses the UDP/IP protocol for sending and receiving packets.
    (Although it is theoretically possible to send OSC-packets over TCP, almost all known implementations use UDP) 
    
    OSC-packets come in two kinds:
    - OSC-messages consist of an 'address'-string (not to be confused with a (host:port) network-address!),
    followed by a string of 'typetags' associated with the message's arguments (ie. 'payload'), 
    and finally the arguments themselves, encoded in an OSC-specific way.
    The OSCMessage class makes it easy to create & manipulate OSC-messages of this kind in a 'pythonesque' way
    (that is, OSCMessage-objects behave a lot like lists)
    
    - OSC-bundles are a special type of OSC-message containing only OSC-messages as 'payload'. Recursively.
    (meaning; an OSC-bundle could contain other OSC-bundles, containing OSC-bundles etc.)
    OSC-bundles start with the special keyword '#bundle' and do not have an OSC-address. (but the OSC-messages 
    a bundle contains will have OSC-addresses!)
    Also, an OSC-bundle can have a timetag, essentially telling the receiving Server to 'hold' the bundle until
    the specified time.
    The OSCBundle class allows easy cration & manipulation of OSC-bundles.
            
    see also http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0
    
    ---------
    
    To send OSC-messages, you need an OSCClient, and to receive OSC-messages you need an OSCServer.
    
    The OSCClient uses an 'AF_INET / SOCK_DGRAM' type socket (see the 'socket' module) to send 
    binary representations of OSC-messages to a remote host:port address.
    
    The OSCServer listens on an 'AF_INET / SOCK_DGRAM' type socket bound to a local port, and handles
    incoming requests. Either one-after-the-other (OSCServer) or in a multi-threaded / multi-process fashion 
    (ThreadingOSCServer / ForkingOSCServer). If the Server has a callback-function (a.k.a. handler) registered
    to 'deal with' (i.e. handle) the received message's OSC-address, that function is called, passing it the (decoded) message
    
    The different OSCServers implemented here all support the (recursive) un-bundling of OSC-bundles,
    and OSC-bundle timetags.
    
    In fact, this implementation supports:
    
    - OSC-messages with 'i' (int32), 'f' (float32), 's' (string) and 'b' (blob / binary data) types
    - OSC-bundles, including timetag-support
    - OSC-address patterns including '*', '?', '{,}' and '[]' wildcards.
    
    (please *do* read the OSC-spec! http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0 it explains what these things mean.) 
    
    In addition, the OSCMultiClient supports:
    - Sending a specific OSC-message to multiple remote servers
    - Remote server subscription / unsubscription (through OSC-messages, of course)
    - Message-address filtering.
